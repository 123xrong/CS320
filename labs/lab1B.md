# Lab 1B: Git

1. Join your breakout room

2. Get to know your group members, asking each other the following:

* Name + major
* What is your hometown, and what is your favorite place there?
* If you could create a silly law, what would it be?

3. Finish VM setup if you haven't done so

4. Practice using the [Git Simulator](./git-sim)

5. Try [merging branches](./git-conflict) and conflict resolution

6. Create a GitHub account and learn how to create a [pull request](./git-pr) to suggest changes to GitHub repos that you don't own
