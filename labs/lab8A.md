# Lab 8A: Regression

1. Share with your group: *What is your favorite Python module, and why?* It could be something we use in 320, or something you learned elsewhere.

2. Use a [LinearRegression](./regression) to predict how long it will take to run a piece of code

3. Learn how to query a [SQL database](./sql-join) to get a pandas DataFrame

4. Continue working on [P6](../p6)
